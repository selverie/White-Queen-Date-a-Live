                While traveling in the Ninth Region Yesod with Hibiki, Kurumi encounters her. The White Queen, who
                suddenly appeared in the Neighboring World, is the biggest enemy to all
                Quasi-Spirits due to the magnitude of her threat level. War has been ongoing against her forces based in
                Binah, the Third Region, which she has taken over as her headquarters. She has spread her influence
                across the Neighboring World, and is corrupting other regions from the inside out in order to achieve
                her goal.

                White Queen wears a white military dress decorated with epaulettes, and a white admiral's cap with an
                emblem similar to that of a rising sun on the front of it. In the middle of the emblem is a clock face.
                She also wears white gloves and heeled boots. She has long white hair usually tied in symmetrical twin
                tails. Her right eye is red-tinted while her left eye has a distinct blue clock engraved. She is stated
                to look identical to Kurumi, aside from the obvious color scheme difference.

                The White Queen has a composed and regal disposition. However, that is merely a façade as she sees her
                followers as pawns for her to use and sacrifice. According to the Empty serving in her palace, the Queen
                can tell them to die, but she will never show any gratitude. While very easy to see through, this façade
                is strangely sweet, cheery, and similar to the disposition of a regal queen.
                <br /><br />
                Rather than a battle maniac, the White Queen is a strategist. She performed infiltration, acts of
                terrorism, and experiments to change Empty into monsters to strengthen her army. She also captured and
                tortured Cistus to study and exploit Zafkiel's power. The White Queen is also callous, aggressive and
                intelligent. These traits combined together make for a formidable opponent, and this was acknowledged by
                the other Dominions. She has immense power, and all the tools at her disposal to back it up. She is
                considered and careful when planning attacks and engaging in battle, and will sacrifice her own soldiers
                when needed to ensure a victory. She also has the capacity to forward plan, and is uninhibited by taboos
                in the Neighboring World, one of these including encroaching on other Regions. The White Queen is
                goal-oriented and believes that her goal is far more important than the lives of her enemies and allies,
                as shown by how readily she sacrifices her own troops.
                <br /><br />
                The White Queen has multiple personalities due to using the Scorpion Bullet on herself. As a
                result, her speech can be unstable, changing styles throughout sentences. Including the original
                Overlord personality, there are 6 personalities in total. Each personality is in charge of a
                specific role for the Queen. General excels in fighting, Lady seduces and corrupts Quasi-Spirits,
                Executioner specializes in executions, Agent carries out infiltration work, and Politician takes
                command of the Empties. The personalities can also mentally communicate with each other, often
                dictating a specific personality in charge of a given task.

                The White Queen was originally Kurumi's childhood friend Sawa Yamauchi. One day, after being given the
                incomplete Camael Sephira by Mio Takamiya, she transformed into a monster that indiscriminately
                scattered flames to her surroundings. Confused and not knowing what was going on, Sawa ran into Kurumi,
                who killed her while thinking she was just another monster and not her best friend. After death, Sawa's
                soul arrived at the Neighboring World, where she had a once in a million encounter with an inverted
                Kurumi Tokisaki clone accidentally created through the Eighth Bullet &lt;Het&gt; reproducing the moment
                of her near inversion from killing her best friend. The clone discarded by the original and Sawa, who
                was
                now reduced to a soul, merged together from their shared grudge against the original Kurumi
                Tokisaki. From this unexpected union, the White Queen was born with a burning hatred for her old
                friend and the world that allowed such a tragedy to occur.
